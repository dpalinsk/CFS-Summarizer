Despite past issues of change in political regimes within the Portuguese administration, analysts expect Portugal’s economy will be able to withstand the latest change in government (the April 3rd ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and government).
There has been a continued trend of the economy becoming less reliant on the political shifts of the country.
Portugal’s leading politicians worry about Soares’ decision in regard to actions taken after PSD’s ousting.
Some state that a PSD majority may allow for more reform across the board. PSD politicians feel that left-wingers were the cause of the slow passing of important economic reforms.
While left-wingers believe that the PSD politicians are falsely stating that Portugal’s economic growth was more due to international conditions than PSD policies.
