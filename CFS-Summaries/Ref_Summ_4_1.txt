Helmut Schlesinger, the vice president of the Bundesbank, said that he is not going to lower interest rates.
Money supply and prices were stable, so lower interest rates served no purpose, he said. 
The U.S. wanted Germany to boost imports, but Schlesinger thinks that the first quarter slowdown came down to poor weather, as well as the quick downturn of the dollar. 
Germany plans to stay the course.
