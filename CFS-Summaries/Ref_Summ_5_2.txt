MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC ' s official levels , industry sources said . 
Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter , the sources said .
They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April , but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices . 
Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower , oil traders said .
The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC ' s December production agreement , while agreeing to the fixed prices . 
But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first - half 1987 ceiling of 15 . 8 mln bpd , supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter . 
He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products , reducing them to levels well below this time last year . 
He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude . A Japanese refiner said , " The European and U . S . Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky ."
