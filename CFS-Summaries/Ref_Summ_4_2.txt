NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK ' S SCHLESINGER Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now . i
Concerned by the first quarter downturn , the U . S . Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports , either through fiscal or monetary policy .
" It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly ," he said , noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample .
The recent widening of interest rate differentials , the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar , he said .
Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise , as the U . S . Did in March when the dollar rose above 1 . 87 marks , he said this would depend on the circumstances . 
He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar ' s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now .
"The sharp rise of the mark , coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil , had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year .
