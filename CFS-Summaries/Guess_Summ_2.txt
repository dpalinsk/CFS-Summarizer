U . S . TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES The United States is prepared to " pull out all the stops " to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), U . S . 
Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said . 
Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community ' s ( EC ) agricultural support policies , he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association . 
He reiterated Washington ' s firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone - fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee . 
The U . S . claims the EC directive , due to come into effect on January 1 , threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U . S . meat shipments into the EC . 
The U . S . also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U . S . trade via the EC oilseeds regime , which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax , Samuels said . 
Reduction of trade - distorting world agricultural subsidies , an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations , " is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected ," Samuels said . 
Samuels called the U . S . plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000 , proposed at GATT in July , " visionary " and " very serious ." 
The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic .
