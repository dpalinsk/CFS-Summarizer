MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC ' s official levels , industry sources said . 
They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16 . 50 dlrs a barrel , compared to its official price of 17 . 42 dlrs . 
Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter , the sources said . 
The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of Iranian crude under term contracts , but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter . 
It is lifting just 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 bpd . 
They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April , but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices . 
" If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17 . 30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price ," one Japanese refiner said . 
" We don ' t intend to put pressure on them ," he added . 
Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower , oil traders said .
