The European Community (EC) and the U.S. are currently in a disagreement about the U.S.â€™s Agricultural trade rights under the GATT.
The EC wishes to ban all hormone-fed meat, in addition to favoring EC prices for oilseed rather than current market prices. 
The U.S. is not against short term reforms to the GATT, as long as they help to resolve larger issues within the policy. 
Mainly, the U.S. wish to eliminate farm subsidies, while the EC only wishes to reduce them.
