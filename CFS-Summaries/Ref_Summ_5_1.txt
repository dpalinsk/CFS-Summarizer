Japanese companies aren't renewing oil contracts with Iran because the pricing is wrong. 
This is decreasing the number of barrels of oil processed by Japan from 185000 barrels to 10-15k.
If the price gets better, Japanese companies say they would buy again. 
Qatar has also faced problems moving its oil. Nigeria said they would hold up the December OPEC agreement. 
If the US and European markets continue to improve, more companies will buy OPEC oil.
