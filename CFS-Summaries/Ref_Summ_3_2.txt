New Jersey - based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E . F . Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator ' s U . S . courier business.
Hutton said the acquiring company , PC Acquisition Inc , is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator ' s stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday .
The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition , containing Purolator ' s U . S . courier operations.
Purolator ' s stock price closed at 35 . 125 dlrs on Friday .
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s , at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs .
It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs , and previously sold its auto filters business . 
Purolator ' s courier business has been lagging that of its U . S . rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet
