Messenger company Purolator Courier Corp agreed to be acquired by a new company, formed by Hutton LBO Inc and some Purolator managers.
Hutton will be the majority owner, paying 35 dollars per share. Shareholders will receive $29/share in cash and other benefits. 
Purolator has been selling off other departments for a while. 
Purolator sold because they lost 120 million dollars over the last two years. 
The ICC must review the acquisition.
