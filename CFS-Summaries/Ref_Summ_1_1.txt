Portugal's economy is doing quite well, which may enable it to shrug off the country's latest crisis.
The goernment was oused on April 3, creating fears of instability, but the economy itself appears to be developed enough to withstand these fears. 
The business community wants there to be new elections held in the near future, but the left-wing parties want to form a new government from the parliament. 
The left-wingers say that natural resources caused the strong economy rather than economic policies.
