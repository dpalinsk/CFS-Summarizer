NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK ' S SCHLESINGER Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now . 
With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark , Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed . 
The economy is picking up , after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 / 2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth , he added . 
" We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter ," he said in an interview . 
Concerned by the first quarter downturn , the U . S . Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports , either through fiscal or monetary policy . 
Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions , just as occured in 1986 . 
Year - on - year growth was thus about two pct . 
He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct . 
" It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly ," he said , noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample . 
Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year - on - year pace of 7 - 1 / 2 to eight pct , well above the Bundesbank ' s three to six pct target . 
He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long - term capital flows . 
Heavy inflows , particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation , boosted domestic money supply . 
" There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed ," Schlesinger said . 
A major reason for the inflows was the market ' s conviction that the mark was headed higher .
