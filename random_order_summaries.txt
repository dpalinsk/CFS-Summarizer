NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold , a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities . 
Over the past three weeks , Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions , drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year . 
And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse - First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character , though they are aimed at a less professional market . 
But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future . 
Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co - led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty ( Switzerland ) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York . 
" Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold ." 
The gold market , having seen strong gains in 1986 , has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks . 
But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited . 
But after a quick flurry of issues , that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks . 
Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank ' s issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium . 
Whatever the calculation , the issues have received a warm welcome from investors . 

NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold , a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities . 
Over the past three weeks , Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions , drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year . 
And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse - First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character , though they are aimed at a less professional market . 
Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank ( Switzerland ) AG said : " The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long - term investment in gold with limited risk ." 
Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co - led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty ( Switzerland ) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York . 
The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce , the same price as the underlying commodity , to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank . 
Citicorp ( Switzerland ) pioneered warrants with a series of equity - linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years , and last autumn , Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens , and to play it with higher leverage . 
Using a Black Sholes options model , he said the issue ' s long , 4 . 3 - year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24 . 5 pct for the option to pay off , which he claimed was lower than the other issues . 
But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science . 
" The most sophisticated ones wouldn ' t buy these because the premiums are too high ," he said .

PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX Philippine Coconut Authority ( PCA ) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community ( EC ) levy on vegetable oil imports . 
He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position . 
Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany , the Netherlands , Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax . 
Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin , a carcinogenic chemical . 
He said the EC standard of 0 . 02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal , which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 , was too rigid . 
Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non - food products , or we can go to the chemical root ." 
He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop . 
With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil , a coconut oil substitute , palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 , Romero said . 
" To add to that the U . S . 
Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart ," he said . 
That ' s a lot of space ," Romero said . 

PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX Philippine Coconut Authority ( PCA ) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community ( EC ) levy on vegetable oil imports . 
" I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines ," Romero said in an interview . 
Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin , a carcinogenic chemical . 
Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards . 
Romero said he would also visit Oxford University ' s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether . 
" There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra ," Romero said . 
With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil , a coconut oil substitute , palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 , Romero said . 
Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five - year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests . 
Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees , he said . 
He said the government ' s proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven - hectares of land .

LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector , traders said . 
London Metal Exchange ( LME ) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower . 
This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady , if unspectacular , physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed . 
Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems , lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz ' s smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks . 
On the demand side , winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U . S . Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U . K . Soviet lead buying , notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year , was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March . 
Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery . 
On stocks , the popular LME Continental warehouses , Antwerp and Rotterdam , have little more than 3 , 000 tonnes of lead each , and this is believed to be in strong hands . 
Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices , with contracts expiring end - April at Cominco ' s Trail and Kimberley , B . C ., Mine / smelter and at Doe Run ' s Herculaneum , Mo , smelter . 
Traders said LME three months delivery , already attracting speculative buying , could rise to 320 / 330 stg on current firmness , while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four . 
Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession . 

LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector , traders said . 
The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which , as peak winter demand tails off , stocks usually build fast and availability increases , traders said . 
This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply / demand balance within the U . S . Market , for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market . 
Mexican supplies , which have sometimes swelled LME stocks , have been normal but are finding ready buyers , traders said . 
On the demand side , winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U . S . Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U . K . Soviet lead buying , notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year , was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March . 
Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery . 
Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR , traders said . 
Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments . 
Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls , which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries . 
Traders said LME three months delivery , already attracting speculative buying , could rise to 320 / 330 stg on current firmness , while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four .

GATT WARNS U . S . ON FEDERAL BUDGET , PROTECTIONISM The United States ' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country ' s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit , the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) said . 
The fundamental problem , the size of the U . S . Federal budget deficit , could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt , it said . 
GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2 . 5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years . 
The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies , it added . 
GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U . S . Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar . 
" Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates , which , in turn , would adversely affect world trade ." 
But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States , despite the dollar ' s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive . 
It suggested that resources idle in the U . S ., Both human and in underutilised factories , were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad . 
Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct , continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade , GATT said . 
Developing countries ' exports declined significantly , while their imports increased moderately , although full statistics are not available yet , GATT said . 
The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower , and only five of them ( Chile , Colombia , Philippines , South Korea , and Thailand ) had higher exports . 

GATT WARNS U . S . ON FEDERAL BUDGET , PROTECTIONISM The United States ' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country ' s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit , the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) said . 
By stressing its record trade deficit of 169 . 8 billion dlrs last year , the U . S . Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system , it said in an annual report . 
The fundamental problem , the size of the U . S . Federal budget deficit , could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt , it said . 
GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2 . 5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years . 
GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings , lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit . 
" The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain ," the report said . 
GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar , risk of higher U . S . Inflation , concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism .

BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING & lt ; V > The Bank of New York Corp & lt ; BK > said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York ' s share price to 30 - 1 / 8 , a Bank of New York spokesman said . 
Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares . 
In late September , Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47 . 4 pct of Irving . 
At that time , the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share , but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs , one analyst said . 
" If it gets to the Irving shareholders , they would approve it , but Irving hopes the offer won ' t go to the shareholders ," said Mark Alpert , banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc . " And the market is saying the deal won ' t go through ," Alpert said . 
If Irving wouldn ' t go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share , then they won ' t go at a lower price ," another analyst said . 
" With Irving ' s price so low , Bank of New York ' s offer will look good to Irving shareholders ," said Michael Flores , a consultant at Bank Earnings International , a consulting firm . 
The drop of Irving ' s share to 44 dlrs per share , which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week , increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed , Flores said . 
" Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can ' t use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed ," Alpert said . 
Since only banks can buy another bank , the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank , Alpert said .

Earlier this month , Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence . 
In late September , Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47 . 4 pct of Irving . 
According to the prospectus offer , shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come , first serve basis . 
" If it gets to the Irving shareholders , they would approve it , but Irving hopes the offer won ' t go to the shareholders ," said Mark Alpert , banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc . " And the market is saying the deal won ' t go through ," Alpert said .

ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U . S .- JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the U . S . And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia ' s exporting nations that the row could inflict far - reaching economic damage , businessmen and officials said . 
They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U . S . Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U . S . And lead to curbs on American imports of their products . 
The U . S . Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17 , in retaliation for Japan ' s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost . 
" If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports ( of goods subject to tariffs ) to the U . S .," said Tom Murtha , a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker & lt ; James Capel and Co >. 
" We must quickly open our markets , remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U . S . Products , if we want to defuse problems from possible U . S . 
A senior official of South Korea ' s trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U . S . And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea , whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan . 
In Malaysia , trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard - hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U . S . 
The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U . S . And Japan with interest and concern , Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday . 
He said Australia ' s concerns centred on coal and beef , Australia ' s two largest exports to Japan and also significant U . S . Exports to that country . 
Deputy U . S . Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda , Japan ' s deputy minister of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute .

The U . S . Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17 , in retaliation for Japan ' s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost . 
Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes . 
Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15 . 6 billion dlrs last year , 95 pct of it with the U . S . 
The surplus helped swell Taiwan ' s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs , among the world ' s largest .

In Malaysia , trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard - hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U . S . 
But other businessmen said such a short - term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U . S . Pressure to block imports . 
They also call for stepped - up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone ' s avowed fiscal reform program .

COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES & lt ; San Miguel Corp >, SMC , and & lt ; United Coconut Planters Bank >, UCPB , have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38 . 1 mln shares of SMC , the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said . 
Ramon Diaz , Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government ( PCGG ) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block , held in trust by the UCPB . 
" It looks good ," Diaz said . 
But he added several issues , including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares , had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale . 
The PCGG ' s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC ' s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group . 
The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco , an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos . 
" The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1 . 4 mln coconut farmers ," Diaz said . 
PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC ' s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year . 
The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4 . 79 billion peso transaction , 1 . 6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment , the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC , 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB - controlled trading companies . 
President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three - man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue . 
De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC ' s board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan .

The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3 . 3 billion pesos . 
PCGG sources said SMC , the Philippines ' largest food and beverage manufacturer , has agreed to sell 14 mln " B " class shares from the 38 . 1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share .

Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986 , well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period , but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats .

U . S . MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE Today ' s turmoil in the U . S . Financial markets , with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar ' s wake , is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead , economists said . 
For two years , the markets had hailed the dollar ' s decline as the cure - all for the U . S . Trade deficit . 
Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one - way street , up . 
The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances , short of further depreciation of the dollar . 
Bonds suffered their biggest one - day drop in months amid worries that the dollar ' s slide will rekindle inflation , scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit . 
Norman Robertson , Mellon Bank chief economist , called the markets ' instability frightening . 
He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that " once you start the ball rolling it ' s difficult to stop ." 
Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year , but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing , whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession . 
Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar ' s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen , the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G - 7 Paris agreement in February . 
But in the short term , given the failure of the G - 7 and of central bank intervention , some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar . 
Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates , even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers , Latin American governments and others . 

U . S . MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE Today ' s turmoil in the U . S . Financial markets , with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar ' s wake , is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead , economists said . 
But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker ' s often - repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse . 
" Volcker ' s been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he ' s got it ," said David Jones , economist at Aubrey G . Lanston and Co Inc . 
The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances , short of further depreciation of the dollar . 
Bonds suffered their biggest one - day drop in months amid worries that the dollar ' s slide will rekindle inflation , scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit . 
Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington , has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3 . 47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare . 
Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year , but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing , whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession . 
Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar ' s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen , the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G - 7 Paris agreement in February . 
Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates , even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers , Latin American governments and others . 
But for now , market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out .
